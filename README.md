# Official repo of the isosceles discord bot

**Some of the bot's code is very messy, as I wrote some of the functions a long time ago, but they work.**

## Isosceles is a server economy bot that gives points to users when they chat in servers, along with many other commands.

Users gain points, and then can gamble with points, as well as pay other users, and see leadboards
Points of course, are independent of the server and will transfer from server to server

The bot is currently in development and many more features are soon to come

Features in the works:

  - Server moderation
  - Reddit integration
  - And more! Suggestions are welcome on the discord server
